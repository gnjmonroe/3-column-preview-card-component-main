## My Process

### Project Goals

- Continue practicing semantic HTML.
- Continue practicing SCSS concepts.
- Continue practicing the process of setting up for a project more so than executing said project.
- Achieve as close to a perfect replica as reasonably possible (e.g., 100% accurate spacing values are not worth an hour of time).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass/SCSS
  - Partials, variables, etc.
- CSS Style Guide (BEM)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

Compared to the last project, this was a breeze. I probably should have started with this project actually. I think it took me roughly 2 hours, including a generous planning stage. That said, I'm not sure that I learned that much. I can certainly say that I was much more comfortable in my workflow and technology stack this time around but I think I'm ready to up my game in the next project.

### Major Challenges

N/A

### Continued Development

I think the best thing I can do is to start doing harder projects ASAP. In preparation for that, I'll read [This](https://css-tricks.com/approaches-media-queries-sass/) and [this](https://www.sitepoint.com/managing-responsive-breakpoints-sass/) before the next project. I actually forgot to read them before this one.

In the next project, I'll also include a section in the README for a time budget estimate and how long it actually took me. I think this will be a good way work on my time estimation skills that I mentioned in the previous project.

Addition semantic HTML practice will be helpful too.
